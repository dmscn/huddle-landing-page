## Huddle Landing Page

This project was a (Frontend Mentor)[https://beta.frontendmentor.io/challenges/huddle-landing-page-with-single-introductory-section-5ca5f0ef1e82137ec91a50fa] challenge. The project consists in a responsive landing page (mobile & desktop). 

# Techs

I used this challenge as an exercise to experiment new features and libs for ReactJS. For simplicity reasons I used CRA to build the project with simple JavaScript to accelerate the development. With that in mind, this wouldn't be the stack I would use in a real world project. 

For the responsive behavior I decided to use `react-socks`. And to style my app I opted to use `styled-components`.
